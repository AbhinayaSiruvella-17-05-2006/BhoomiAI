🔥 Ollama Integration
🔹 Local Development

Ollama is used for AI-based text generation

Model: llama3.2:1b

Generates intelligent agriculture advisory responses

🔹 Production Deployment (Render)

Ollama is conditionally disabled

Application remains stable without runtime crashes

Clean fallback messages are returned when AI is unavailable

This hybrid approach ensures:

Full AI capabilities during development

Production-safe deployment without system failure
